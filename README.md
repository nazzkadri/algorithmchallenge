Algorithmic Complexity
Makers apprenticeship course week 10.

Learning objectives
By the end of this week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to these questions:

Can you mention efficiency as one of the dimension of a good piece of code
Can you join a conversation about algorithms and their complexity?
Timing code
Using Java, created code to test execution time for methods (among others):

last (builtin)
reverse (builtin)
shuffle (builtin)
sort (builtin)
Build your own algorithms
Here are a few algorithms you should try to implement and optimise:
